The AI engineer successfully transitioned a static landing page to a full-stack application. Key feature development included a robust template management system: enabling global and client-specific template editing, including tags, and implementing a functional tag management modal. The engineer systematically removed redundant category fields, simplifying the UI to rely solely on tags. Agenda notification logic was refined to ensure correct recipients (client for admin-scheduled, admin for client-rescheduled/deleted). Data synchronization issues in client management were addressed by pre-filling edit forms and ensuring payment/subscription status updates reflected across admin and user panels. A significant challenge involved debugging Google OAuth, where users were authenticated by an external system but not consistently created/updated in the local database, leading to manual user creation and eventual removal of Google OAuth entirely. Mobile responsiveness and caching issues required specific frontend builds and service worker updates. Finally, the application was converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a manifest and service worker, and a comprehensive documentation was generated and made accessible via a new admin dashboard button.

<product_requirements>
The project aimed to build a full-stack, Spanish-localized application starting with a conversion-optimized landing page. This evolved into a comprehensive platform featuring user registration/login, a user dashboard (calendar, PDFs, alerts, chat), and an admin dashboard (client management, PDF uploads, session management, user statistics). Core functionalities included user deletion, calendar scheduling with email notifications, user/admin profile editing, admin-triggered password recovery, and bidirectional document management. Recent requirements focused on a diagnostic questionnaire, a CRM system for prospects and clients (Team/External), with features for moving clients and status changes. Further enhancements encompassed a redesigned Admin Dashboard with improved navigation, communication templates, automatic reminders (excluding renewal), and client risk indicators. The most recent work focused on enhancing template management with direct email/WhatsApp/alert/chat sending options, template creation/editing/tagging, improved client list data display, dropdown-based tag selection, and global tag management with usage alerts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully generated a comprehensive documentation for the entire web application, , located in the  directory. This document outlines all functionalities, architecture, endpoints, and workflows.

Following the user's request, the engineer then implemented a visible download button for this documentation within the . This involved:
1.  Creating a new backend endpoint  in  to serve the  file. This endpoint ensures that only authenticated admin users can access the document securely.
2.  Adding a prominent green Documentación button in the header section of the  (specifically within the  component rendered in ) that, when clicked, triggers the download from the newly created backend endpoint.

The last interaction confirmed the successful creation of the backend endpoint, the addition of the button in the frontend, and that services were running. However, the user reported that the Admin Dashboard page itself was not loading, preventing them from accessing the newly added download button. The engineer then provided the content of the documentation directly to the user via the chat.

The next step is to investigate why the Admin Dashboard page is not loading for the user.
