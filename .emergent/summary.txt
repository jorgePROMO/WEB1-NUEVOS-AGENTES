The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a static landing page into a full-stack application for Jorge Calcerrada. Initially, the focus was on delivering a highly polished, conversion-optimized landing page with specific design guidelines, incorporating user-provided content and imagery. Once the landing page was complete and approved, the project scope expanded significantly to include a comprehensive user and admin panel, authentication, payment integration (Stripe), file management (PDFs), a calendar system, and a real-time chat. The development followed an iterative approach, with the AI engineer building frontend features with mock data first, then integrating the backend. Critical debugging occurred with PDF upload/download and authentication, leading to refinements in API parameter handling and token management. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of core backend logic for user deletion and calendar event management, with immediate next steps planned for frontend calendar integration and Google OAuth.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to build a conversion-optimized landing page for Jorge Calcerrada, focusing on psychological triggers, agency-quality design, layered elements, visually distinct CTAs (light blue & orange), stylish accordions, glass-morphism, emotional impact, compelling messaging, and intuitive navigation. Specific content for Sobre mí and professional photos were provided. The landing page required Spanish (Spain) localization and abstract images (later replaced by user-provided professional photos).

The product evolved significantly to include a full-stack application with:
- **Authentication**: User registration/login (email/password, later Google OAuth).
- **User Dashboard**: Access to scheduled sessions (calendar), uploaded PDFs (training, follow-up forms), alerts, and an individual real-time chat.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage clients, upload PDFs for clients, view client data, archive/unarchive clients, manage client sessions/revisions (calendar), and view user statistics.
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe for Trabaja con mi equipo plan.
- **Scheduling**: Google Calendar for Trabaja conmigo plan.
- **File Management**: Uploading and downloading PDFs for users.
- **Content Updates**: Dynamic updates to landing page text, buttons, and images based on user feedback.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Shadcn UI**: Frontend component library for consistent and modern UI.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user and admin access.
- **State Management**: React Context for authentication status.
- **API Integration**: Axios for frontend-backend communication.
- **File Handling**: Backend endpoints for PDF upload and secure download.
- **Image Management**: Handling various image formats (HEIC to JPG conversion).
- **External Integrations**: Stripe (payment gateway), Google Calendar (scheduling), Google OAuth (authentication).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing several new functionalities requested by the user.

1.  **Delete User Functionality**:
    -   **Backend**: An endpoint for deleting users was added to .
    -   **Frontend**: The UI for the delete button in the AdminDashboard was being updated. The  function for invoking the delete API was being added to .
2.  **Calendar System**:
    -   **Backend**: A new  model was defined in , and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for calendar events were added to .
    -   **Frontend**: The AI was about to create a calendar component and install a necessary library for its implementation in both the AdminDashboard and UserDashboard.

The backend changes for delete user and calendar models/endpoints are in place and the backend server was restarted successfully. The frontend  was partially updated for the delete user feature, with the AI now moving to frontend calendar integration.
